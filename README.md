# hill-developer-portfolio
For this assignment we created a portfolio page displaying our group project as well as two exemplary homework assignments.  I wasn't sure whether we were just updating our Responsive Portfolio homework assignment to reflect completed assignments or creating a new one, so I just created a new one.  The template was almost copy and paste from the RP homework assignment and adjustments were made based on needed criteria for the assignment.

I kept the same styling as the RP assignment as I liked the color scheme, but this will definitely be a continual work in progress not only updating the portfolio, but polishing the styling and other content.  In addition to the portfolio end of it, I updated my resume, GitHub profile, and LinkedIn profile (though not too much to update currently).
